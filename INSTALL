INSTALL file for PyFCP

System requirements:

The basic core library fcp.py, as well as the XML-RPC server
fcpxmlrpc.py, and sitemgr.py, all require:

 - Python2.3 or later
 - access to a freenet FCP port, on same or other machine

The freesite insertion script updatesites.py also requires:
 - *nix environment
 - knowledge of where your freenet software is installed

We recommend that you copy fcp.py and fcpxmlrpc.py to
somewhere on your python sys.path
(eg, /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages).

Alternatively, you could just have them in the same
directory as your application, and import them from there
