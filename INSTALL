INSTALL file for PyFCP

System requirements:

   This package requires:
     - Python2.3 or later
     - access to a freenet FCP port, on same or other machine
     - third party module 'SSLCrypto' (source included here)

Installation:

   1) Test if SSLCrypto is installed

      If you already have the Python 'SSLCrypto' package installed,
      you can skip to step 3.

      You can test if SSLCrypto is installed by typing:

        $ python -c "import SSLCrypto"

      If the command completes quietly, then SSLCrypto is installed
      and working. Otherwise, if you see something like 'ImportError:...',
      you need to install SSLCrypto.

   2) Install SSLCrypto if needed

      (i)   go in to the 'dependencies' directory
      (ii)  unpack both the 'Pyrex...' and the 'SSLCrypto...' tarballs
      (iii) cd into the 'Pyrex-...' directory, become root, then type:

               python setup.py install

      (iv)  cd into the 'SSLCrypto...' directory, become root, then type:

               python setup.py install

   3) Now, you should be able to install pyfcp and its applications.
      To do this, get back into the toplevel pyfcp directory, then
      become root, then type 'python setup.py install'
