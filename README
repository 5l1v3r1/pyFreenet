README file for PyFCP

PyFCP is a Python client library for Freenet FCP that aims
to be easy to use, yet flexible enough to accomodate a wide range
of programming mind-sets.

This PyFCP release includes:

 - core fcp.py library module

 - fcpxmlrpc.py - a server that exposes the basic FCP primitives
   over an XML-RPC connection

 - sitemgr.py - a utility for freesite insertion

 - updatesites.py - a cron-able wrapper for sitemgr.py

 - start.sh and stop.sh - short scripts to start/stop freenet,
   that can be executed in a plain shell cron environment

Refer to the API documentation in the 'html' directory
for detailed information.
