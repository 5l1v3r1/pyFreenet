README file for PyFCP

PyFCP is a Python client library for Freenet FCP that aims
to be easy to use, yet flexible enough to accomodate a wide range
of programming mind-sets.

This PyFCP release includes:

 - python package 'fcp', containing:
    - 'node' - core FCP node interface
    - 'sitemgr' - freesite management class
    - 'xmlrpc' - freenet XML-RPC server

 - various command-line client apps, which will get installed as
   executable commands in your PATH, including:
     - freesitemgr - a simple yet flexible freesite management utility
     - fcpget - a single key fetcher
     - fcpput - a single key inserter

To get good API documentation, run:

    $ epydoc -n "PyFCP API manual" -o html fcp

When you install this package (refer INSTALL), you should 
end up with a command 'freesitemgr' on your PATH.

'freesitemgr' is a console-based freesite insertion utility
which keeps your freesite configs and status in a single
config file (~/.freesites, unless you specify otherwise).

Invoke 'freesitemgr -h' (or if on windows, 'freesitemgr.py -h')
and read the options.
